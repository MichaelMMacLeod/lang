Definition of [primitive objects (S,F,=)]: An implementation-defined
pair (S,F,=), where S is a set, F is the [??? failure fixed-point],
and = is an equivalence relation on S.

Definition of [=]: The equivalence relation = the [primitive objects
(S,F,=)].

Definition of [set of primitive objects]: The set S in the [primitive
objects (S,F,=)].

Definition of [list of type T]: An ordered collection of objects of
type T, finite in size, which may contain no objects at all.

Definition of [primitive term]: An object T that is a member of the
[set of primitive objects].

Definition of [term]: An object T is a term if and only if exactly one
of the following holds:

  1. T is a [primitive term].

  2. T is a directed graph where all of the following conditions hold:

    a. For every leaf L of T there exists a [primitive term] P such
       that L is labeled P.

    b. For every vertex V of T there exists a non-negative integer U
       such that for all integers I less than or equal to U, there
       exists an edge E emanating from T such that E is labeled I.

Definition of [Rule from T1 to T2]: a pair (T1,T2), where both T1 and
T2 are [term]s.

Definition of [rule]: A [rule from T1 to T2] for some T1 and T2.

Definition of [identical]: A [term] T1 is identical to a [term] T2 if
and only if exactly one of the following conditions hold:

  1. T1 [=] T2.

  2. 

Definition of [non-deterministic]: A [rule from T1a to T2a] is said to
be non-deterministic with respect to a [rule from T1b to T2b] if and
only if both of the following conditions hold:

  1. T1a is [??? identical] to T1b.

  2. It is not the case that T2a is [??? identical] to T2b.

Definition of [deterministic]: A rule R1 is deterministic with respect
to a rule R2 if and only if R1 is not [non-deterministic] with respect
to R2.

Definition of [fixed point F of Q]: A [term] F is a fixed point of a
set of [rule]s Q if and only if there exists (F,F) in Q.

Definition of [environment]: A set of [rule]s E where the following
conditions hold:

  1. For all R1 in E, and for all R2 in E, R1 is [deterministic] with
     respect to R2.

  2. There does not exist (_,N) in E such that for all (M,_) in E, N
     is not [??? identical] to M.
