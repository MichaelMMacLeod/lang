Proof of [exists-non-deterministic-rule]:

  1. Because [T is iterated-reducible to Q1 in E], we know there
     exists some non-negative integer N1 such that [T is
     iterated-reducible to Q1 in E with N1 steps].

  2. Because [T is iterated-reducible to Q2 in E], we know there
     exists some non-negative integer N2 such that [T is
     iterated-reducible to Q2 in E with N2 steps].

  3. Suppose that [T is reducible to Q1 in E].

    a. Then, because [T is iterated-reducible to Q2 in E], we know
       that there exists a [term] T2 such that [T is reducible to T2
       in E] and [T2 is iterated-reducible to Q2 in E with (N2-1)
       steps].

    b. Because [T is reducible to Q1 in E] there exists a [rule from T
       to Q1] in E.

    c. Because [T is reducible to T2 in E]

  3. If [T is iterated-reducible to Q1 in E with 1 step], then,
     because of (2), we know that there exists a [term] T2 such that
     [T is reducible to T2 in E] and [T2 is iterated-reducible to Q in
     E with (N2-1) steps].

Proof of [always-uniquely-reducible]:

  1. Assume, for the purposes of finding a contradiction, that there
     exists an [environment] E, [term] T, and [term] T2 such that [T
     is iterated-reducible to T2 in E] but it is not the case that [T
     is uniquely-iterated-reducible to T2 in E].

  2. Then, from the definition of [T is uniquely-iterated-reducible to
     T2 in E], we know that there exists some [term] Q such that Q and
     T are not [identical terms] and [T is iterated-reducible to Q in
     E].

  3. From (2), we know that [T is iterated-reducible to T2 in E] and
     that [T is iterated-reducible to Q in E].

  3. Because E is an [environment], we know that for all rules R1 and
     R2 in E, R1 is [deterministic] with respect to R2.
